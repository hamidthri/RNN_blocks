## Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Implementation
This repository contains the implementation of a basic RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) in Python using NumPy. The code provides functions to perform forward propagation for a single time step (rnn_cell_forward) as well as for the entire time series (rnn_forward).
